# Hi There!
I'm Ying Zhong. You can call me Wingâ€”thatâ€™s how itâ€™s pronounced in Cantonese. 

I'm a PhD student at Department of Human-Centered Computing, Indiana University. I work with Prof.Ekaterina Muravevskaia in the SETH Lab. 

I completed my MA in Film Production Studies and BEng in Digital Media Technology at the School of Intelligent Imagery Engineering, Beijing Film Academy. During my MA and BEng Studies, I worked with [Dr. Feilin Han](http://feilinh.cn) in Virtual Reality Lab.
